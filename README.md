# Expense Tracker Android

Welcome to the Expense Tracker Android app! This project is designed to help users keep track of their daily expenses with ease. The app allows users to add, view, and analyze their expenses using intuitive stats and charts. It is developed using modern Android development practices, including Jetpack Compose, Room Database, Dagger Hilt for dependency injection, and the MVVM architecture.

## Features

- **Add Expense:** Easily add your daily expenses with a few taps.
- **Track Expenses:** View a list of all your expenses, organized by date and category.
- **Analyze with Stats:** Get insights into your spending habits with detailed stats and charts.
  
## Technologies Used

- **Jetpack Compose:** A modern toolkit for building native Android UI.
- **Room Database:** A robust database layer on top of SQLite for managing local data.
- **Dagger Hilt:** A dependency injection library for Android that reduces the boilerplate of manual dependency injection.
- **MVVM Architecture:** Model-View-ViewModel architecture for separating the UI, business logic, and data handling in the app.
